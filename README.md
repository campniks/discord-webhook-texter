# discord-webhook-texter
A simple Tkinter GUI which enables you to send messages via discord webhook integration system.

Input your discord webhook into the topmost text entry box, and press "Send webhook". The code will fail if you do not press the button.
After that you are able to input your message and send. Simple right?. 

This is open source, you can compile it yourself with pyInstaller. A already built version is available if you want that too webhook_Texter.exe.
